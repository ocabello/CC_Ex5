Centuries and centuries of idealism have not 
failed to influence reality. In the very oldest regions of Tlon, it is not an uncommon occurrence for 
lost objects to be duplicated. Two people are looking for a pencil. 
The first one finds it and says nothing. The second finds a second pencil, 
no less real, but more in keeping with his expectation. These secondary 
objects are called hronir and, even though awkward in form, are a little 
larger than the originals. Until recently, the hronir were the accidental 
children of absent mindedness and forgetfulness.
